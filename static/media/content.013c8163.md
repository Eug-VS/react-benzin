## Markdown
[Markdown file](${url}) *(...`$fileName`)* that you can see on the left was parsed and rendered by **BENZIN**! :rocket:
Switch between tabs on the header to explore other markdown templates. :recycle:
Templates on the left are being loaded from the [GitHub](https://github.com), though this pane is generated from plaintext. :pen:
## How do I use this feature?
```
import Markdown from \'react-benzin\';
const data = \'# Header\\nHello, *world!*\';
ReactDOM.render(<Markdown data={data}/>, document.getElementById(\'root\'));
```

`$tryButton`
